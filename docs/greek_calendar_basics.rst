Greek Calendar Basics
=====================

Lunisolar Calendars
-------------------

Like most societies in the ancient Mediterranean, Greeks used a
`lunisolar calendar
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar>`_. This means that
each month was marked by the phases of the moon (”luni-”) while the
year was measured according to the sun (”-solar”), usually by a
solstice or equinox. Every Greek city had its own version of the
calendar, but they all operated on two basic principals:

* Each month begins on a new moon
* The beginning of the the first new moon is related to one of the
  solstices or equinoxes.

These principals have two important consequences:

* Months are a mix of 29 and 30 days long
* The year is 354 days long, which means sometimes it has to be extened to 384 days (an intercalary year)

The Athenian :ref:`festival calendar <festival-cal-definition>` is the
best known among the Greek calendarsand will be used for most
examples. This began on the first new moon after the summer
solstice. In Delphi, the year also began after the summer solstice,
but they used completely different month names. On the island of
Delos, which was culturally close to Athens, some of the month names
were the same as those used in Athens, but their year began after the
*winter* solstice.

The second principal above is phrased the way it is, ”related to one of
the solstices or equinoxes”, because some calendars may have begun
just *before* one of the these solar year markers. In Sparta, for
instance, the year may have begun at the last new moon before the
autumn equinox. This could also be defined according to the month when
the solstice or equinox occurs. In Athens, the summer solstice should
occur in the last month of the year. In Sparta, the autumn equinox
should occur in the first month of the year.

The use of lunisolar calendars in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean
goes back at least to Sumer in the 21st century BCE. Similar to the
alphabet, which was invented once and then adopted by one culture
after another, all lunisolar calendars in the region are essentially
the same.

Festival Calendars
------------------

We use the term ”festival calendar” because the most important aspect
of the calendar for the ancient Greeks was that it told them when
religious observations should occur. There were hundreds of festivals
and sacrifices each year that all needed to be held on specific
dates. Some were widespread, like the `Karneia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carneia>`_ that was observed by all `Dorian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorians>`_ Greeks in the month
Karneios, or the `Thesmophoria
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesmophoria>`_ that widespread among
`Ionians <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionians>`_. Some were very
local, such as the Athenian `Synoikia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoikia>`_, where the Athenians
celebrated the foundation of their city by Theseus every
Hekatombaiṓn 16.

Month Names
^^^^^^^^^^^

Just about every Greek city had its own names for the twelve Lunisolar months, based on the festivals that were most important there. In Athens, the names of the months were, in order:

#. Hekatombaiṓn
#. Metageitniṓn
#. Boēdromiṓn
#. Puanopsiṓn
#. Maimaktēriṓn
#. Posideiṓn
#. Gamēliṓn
#. Anthestēriṓn
#. Elaphēboliṓn
#. Mounukhiṓn
#. Thargēliṓn
#. Skirophoriṓn

In Hekatombaiṓn, the Athenians celebrated four major annual festivals: the Hekatombaia (which gave the month its name) on the 7th, Kronia on the 12th, Synoikia on the 16th, and Panathenaia on the 28th. Some celebrations occured every month. For instance, the 3rd of every month was sacred to Athena, the 6th to Artemis, and the 7th to Apollo. Sometimes these days included a specific celebration, like the Hekatombaiṓn which was celebrated in honor of Apollo and therefore occurred on his day, the 7th.
