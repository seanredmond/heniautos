Greek Calendar Basics
=====================

Lunisolar Calendars
-------------------

Like most societies in the ancient Mediterranean, Greeks used a
lunisolar calendar. This means that each month was marked by the
phases of the moon ("luni-") while the year was measured according to
the sun ("-solar"), usually by a solstice or equinox. Every Greek city
had its own version of the calendar, but they all operated on two
basic principals:

* Each month begins on a new moon
* The beginning of the the first new moon is related to one of the
  solstices or equinoxes.

These principals have two important consequences:

* Months are a mix of 29 and 30 days long
* The year is 354 days long, which means sometimes it has to be extened to 384 days (

The Athenian festival calendar (see :ref:`festival-cal-definition`,
below, for definition of this term) is the best known and will be used
for most examples. This began on the first new moon after the summer
solstice. In Delphi, the year also began after the summer solstice,
but they used completely different month names. On the island of
Delos, which was culturally close to Athens, some of the month names
were the same as those used in Athens, but their year began after the
*winter* solstice.

The second principal above is phrase the way it is, "related to one of
the solstices or equinoxes", because some calendars may have begun
just *before* one of the these solar year markers. In Sparta, for
instance, the year may have begun at the last new moon before the
autumn equinox. This could also be defined according to the month when
the solstice or equinox occurs. In Athens, the summer solstice should
occur in the last month of the year. In Sparta, the autumn equinox
should occur in the first month of the year.

The use of lunisolar calendars in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean
goes back at least to Sumer in the 21st century BCE. Similar to the
alphabet, which was invented once and then adopted by one culture
after another, all lunisolar calendars in the region are essentially
the same.

Each city used a different selection of month names based largely on whichever the religious festivals were most important there. For instance,
