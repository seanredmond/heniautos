    "Starting in the fourth century BCE Athenians, when recording decrees of the ekklesia, frequently used a standard preamble for inscriptions that gave both a prytany date and a festival calendar date. [IG II/III³ 1, 338](http://telota.bbaw.de/ig/digitale-edition/inschrift/IG%20II_III%C2%B3%201,%20338) (=IG II² 338) is a good example that offers the fullest form with no restorations:\n",

    "2. The prytany and tribe that held it: ἐπὶ τῆς Αἰγηίδος πρώτης πρυτανείας, \"...in the first prytany, held by Aigēis...\"\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The year (333/332 BCE, which we know from the árkhōn) was **intercalary** because this prytany (the first) has 39 days. In a normal year, the longest prytanies were 36 days.\n",
    "2. Hekatombaiṓn was **full**. If the 39th day of the prytany is Metageitniṓn 9, the 31st would be Metageitniṓn 1, and therefore the 30th has to be Hekatombaiṓn 30. \n",
    "3. The intercalated month was **not** Hekatombaiṓn because having a second Hekatombaiṓn before Metageitniṓn would push Metageitniṓn into the second prytany. This is hardly surprising, but it is worth keeping in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "I.39 is the 39th day of the year, as is Metageitniṓn 9 if Hekatombaiṓn is full (30 + 9 = 39). The solution to this equation, then, is\n",

In the diagrams below, The first row of each pair represents the 12-month festival year, and the second the ten month conciliar year. full months/long prytanies are represented by darker, green boxes and hollow/short by lighter, beige boxes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first diagram shows an \"ideal\" year according to most rigid conception: perfectly alternating full and hollow months, the conciliar year beginning with all 4 long prytanies. The second diagram shows a \"schematic\" view that is only concerned with the _counts_ of months rather than their arrangement. The festival year starts with five green boxes because there are at least five full months in the year, likewise for the next five beige boxes for the minimum count of five hollow months. The last two boxes are empty because we cannot, in fact, say what they are. If one is full and one hollow, we have an ideal 354-day year. But some years could be 353 days long (both hollow) and some 355 (both full). These last two months, schematically, are wildcards. The conciliar year has no wildcards because they were always 4 long and 6 short. The schematic representation of the conciliar year happens to follow the Rule of Aristotle. but that is just a coincidence.\n",

The months before Elaphēboliṓn, to the left of the dotted line, are the months that must satisfy the equation. The months to the right of the dotted line, with hash marks, are the remaining, unknown months. We can deduce the lengths of some of the unknown months from the known. For instance any normal year has _at least_ five full months as well as five hollow months. In first diagram, DOY 253, only two of the known months are full so at least three of the unknown must be full. Since there are already six known hollow months and the maximum is sevem, the last month is a wildcard. The conciliar year must have four long prytanties; since there is only 1 long prytany to the left of the dotted line, the remaining three have to all be long. The diagrams make it easy to see that only one solution satisfies the Rule of Aristotle, DOY 256, if we believe that that is important.\n",
