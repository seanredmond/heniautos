# Reading Dated Inscriptions

[Top: Intro](README.md) | [Previous: Programming with Heniautos](calendar-equations-command.md)

[IG II/III³ 1, 338](http://telota.bbaw.de/ig/digitale-edition/inschrift/IG%20II_III%C2%B3%201,%20338) (= IG II² 338) provides a good example of a dated prescript in a 4th century Athenian inscription. The prescript gives the bureaucratic details of the decree being recorded.

    ἐπὶ Νικοκράτους ἄρχοντος, ἐπὶ τῆς Αἰγηίδος
    πρώτης πρυτανείας, ἧι Ἀρχέλας Χαιρίου Παλ–
    ληνεὺς ἐγραμμάτευεν· Μεταγειτνιῶνος ἐνά–
    τηι ἱσταμένου· ἐνάτηι καὶ τριακοστῆι τῆς :
    πρυτανείας· τῶν προέδρων ἐπεψήφιζεν Νικί–
    ας Θημακειεύς· ἔδοξεν τῶι δήμωι· Χαιριωνίδ–
    ης Λυσανίου Φλυεὺς εἶπεν· 
    
"In the arkhonship of Nikokrates, in the first prytany held by Aigeis, for which Arkhelas son of Khaireas of Pallḗnē was the secretary; Metageitniṓn 9th; 39th of the prytany; of the presiding committee Nikías of Thēmakós was putting the vote; the people decided; Khairiōnídēs son of Lusanías of Phlúa proposed..."

This is made up of several parts which almost always occur in this order, though sometimes some are left out:

1. The arkhon: ἐπὶ ________ ἄρχοντος with the name of the Arkhon in the genitive. This gives us the year (333/2 in this case)
2. The prytany and tribe: ἐπὶ τῆς ________ ________ πρυτανείας with the name of a tribe and an ordinal number, both in the genitive.
3. The secretary: ἧι ________ ________ ________ ἐγραμμάτευεν usually with the "full legal name" of the secretary. This is made up of the man's name (only men were allowed to take part in Athenian government), the patronymic or name of the man's father, and the demotic or the deme to which he belonged. ἧι, "for which," refers to the Ekklēsía (assembly) or the Boulḗ (council) depending on the context. 
4. The festival date. The name of the month in the genitive and day in the dative. This inscription gives a full festival date, Metageitniṓn 9th. The month is often left out, and sometimes there is no festival date at all.
5. Prytany date. ________ τῆς πρυτανείας with the day in the dative.

More details follow, most commonly who "of the presiding committee" (τῶν προέδρων) was putting matters before the body. Sometimes it is recorded that it was a meeting of the "sovereign" assembly (κυρία ἐκκλησία, there was one each prytany that had specific things to vote on), or that it took place in Peiraieus or Theater of Dionysus. Ἔδοξεν τῶι δήμωι, "the people decided" means, essentially, "the people voted 'Yes'" which is followed by the proposal, introduced by εἶπεν, "so-and-so said" or "proposed"

All the word-spacing, capitalization and punctuation are inserted by modern editors. The original appears something like this:

### Filling Gaps

Because the prescripts follow such a regular formula, and because the inscriptions are often composed in a grid-like style called  [stoichedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichedon), we can often fill in gaps, even large gaps, by deduction. Take, for instance, these first three lines of [IG II/III³ 1, 319](http://telota.bbaw.de/ig/digitale-edition/inschrift/IG%20II_III%C2%B3%201,%20319) which are determined to have 26 letters each:

    [.]ΠΙΦΡΥΝΙ[..................]
    [.]ΑΜΑΝΤΙΔ[..................]
    [.]ΧΑΙΡΕΣ[...................]

Expecting the prescript to begin with ἐπὶ and the name of the arkhon (and knowing that there was an arkhon named Phrynikhos in 337/6) we can immediately fill in most of the first line (remember that any spaces or punctuation we add doesn't count towards the number of characters in the line):

    [ἐ]πὶ Φρυνί[χου ἄρχοντος ἐπὶ τῆς .]
    [.]ΑΜΑΝΤΙΔ[..................]
    [.]ΧΑΙΡΕΣ[...................]

ΑΜΑΝΤΙΔ is clearly the middle of Ἀκαμαντίδος and we have one space at the end of the first line and one at the beginning of the second to fill with α and κ:

    [ἐ]πὶ Φρυνί[χου ἄρχοντος ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀ]-
    [κ]καμαντίδ[ος ................]
    [.]ΧΑΙΡΕΣ[...................]

ΧΑΙΡΕΣ looks like the beginning of the secretary's name (and other inscriptions will tell us that it is Χαιρέστρατος). The name should be preceded by ἧι of the phrase ἧι... ἐγραμμάτευεν, which should itself be preceded by πρυτανείας:

    [ἐ]πὶ Φρυνί[χου ἄρχοντος ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀ]-
    [κ]καμαντίδ[ος ..... πρυτανείας ἧ]
    [ι] Χαιρέσ[τρατος .............]

This now leaves us just five letters for the number of the prytany. The only five-letter option is ἕκτης

    [ἐ]πὶ Φρυνί[χου ἄρχοντος ἐπὶ τῆς Ἀ]-
    [κ]καμαντίδ[ος ἕκτης πρυτανείας ἧ]
    [ι] Χαιρέσ[τρατος .............]

And so we can say that Akamantís held the sixth prytany in 337/6.

## Prescript Vocabulary 

Except for the names of archons and secretaries, the vocabulary of the prescripts is fairly limited since it mostly consists of the names of tribes and months, and the numbers of the prytanies and days. The tables below give letter counts to make it easier to fill in gaps as illustrated above. There is a little bit more variation in spelling than is indicated here, but the forms below are most common.

### Phulaí (or Tribes)

The name of the _phulḗ_ that held the prytany appears in the genitive in the phrase ἐπὶ τῆς ________ ________ πρυτανείας (for example, ἐπὶ τῆς Αἰγηίδος πρώτης πρυτανείας)

| #  | Form         | Name         | Letters |  Years  |
|---:|--------------|--------------|--------:|---------|
| 1  | Ἐρεχθηίδος   | Erekhthēís   | 10      | 508-    |
| 2  | Αἰγηίδος     | Aigēís       | 8       | 508-    |
| 3  | Πανδιονίδος  | Pandionís    | 11      | 508-    |
| 4  | Λεωντίδος    | Leontís      | 9       | 508-    |
| 5  | Ἀκαμαντίδος  | Akamantís    | 11      | 508-    |
| 6  | Οἰνηίδος     | Oinēís       | 8       | 508-    |
| 7  | Κεκροπίδος   | Kekropís     | 10      | 508-    |
| 8  | Ἱπποθωντίδος | Hippothontís | 12      | 508-    |
| 9  | Αἰαντίδος    | Aiantís      | 9       | 508-    |
| 10 | Ἀντιοχίδος   | Antiokhís    | 10      | 508-    |
| 11 | Ἀντιγονίδος  | Antogonís    | 11      | 307-201 |
| 12 | Δημητριάδος  | Dēmētriás    | 11      | 307-201 |
| 13 | Πτολεμαίδος  | Ptolemaís    | 11      | 224–    |
| 14 | Ἀτταλίδος    | Attalís      | 9       | 201-    |

The order of the _phulaí_ was important for some purposes. For instance, most of the time the office of secretary rotated through the _phulaí_ in order, so the _phulḗ_ of the secretary is important evidence for establishing the order and dates of the archons they served alongside. For prytanies, however, the _phulaí_ were chosen by lot so this order has nothing to do with the order in which they served as _prutáneis_

### Prytanies

The number of the prytany appears in the genitive.

| Prytany | Form               | Letters |
|--------:|--------------------|--------:|
| 1st     | πρώτης             | 6       |
| 2nd     | δευτέρας           | 8       |
| 3rd     | τρίτης             | 6       |
| 4th     | τετάρτης           | 8       |
| 5th     | πέμπτης            | 7       |
| 6th     | ἕκτης              | 5       |
| 7th     | ἑβδόμης            | 7       |
| 8th     | ὀγδόης             | 6       |
| 9th     | ἐνάτης             | 6       |
| 10th    | δεκάτης            | 7       |
| 11th    | ἑνδεκάτης          | 9      |
| 12th    | δωδεκάτης          | 9      |
| 13th    | τρίτης καὶ δεκάτης | 16      |


### Days of the Prytany

The days of the prytany are given in basic Greek numbers. Epsilon is often used in place of eta, so forms such as πρότει are as common as πρότηι. The iota at the end would be printed as a subscript in modern literary editions, so both πρότει and πρότηι are equivalents of the more familiar προτῃ.

| Day | Name                    | Letters |
|----:|-------------------------|--------:|
| 1   | πρότηι                  | 6       |

| 25  | πέμπτηι καὶ εἰκοστῆι    | 18      |
| 26  | ἕκτηι καὶ εἰκοστῆι      | 16      |
| 27  | ἑβδόμηι καὶ εἰκοστῆι    | 18      |
| 28  | ὀγδόηι καὶ εἰκοστῆι     | 17      |
| 29  | ἐνάτηι καὶ εἰκοστῆι     | 17      |
| 30  | τριακοστῆι              | 10      |

| 37  | ἑβδόμηι καὶ τριακοστῆι  | 20      |
| 38  | ὀγδόηι καὶ τριακοστῆι   | 19      |
| 39  | ἐνάτηι καὶ τριακοστῆι   | 19      |

### Months

The month appears in the genitive. There are minor spelling variations, but these are the essential forms.

| #  | Name           | Letters |
|---:|----------------|--------:|
| 1  | Ἑκατομβαιῶνος  | 13      |
| 2  | Μεταγειτνιῶνος | 14      |
| 3  | Βοηδρομιῶνος   | 12      |
| 4  | Πυανεψιῶνος    | 11      |
| 5  | Μαιμακτηριῶνος | 14      |
| 6  | Ποσιδειῶνος    | 11      |
| 7  | Γαμηλιῶνος     | 10      |
| 8  | Ἀνθεστηριῶνος  | 13      |
| 9  | Ἐλαφηβολιῶνος  | 13      |
| 10 | Μουνιχιῶνος    | 11      |
| 11 | Θαργηλιῶνος    | 11      |
| 12 | Σκιροφοριῶνος  | 13      |

### Days of the Month

The days appear in the dative and there is a special way of counting the days of the month. The days are arranged in groups of ten, or "decads" and there are special names for the first day (νουμηνία) and last day (ἕνη καὶ νέα). The first 19 days are the same in all periods for both full and hollow months.

| Name               | Day | Letters |
|--------------------|----:|-------:|
| νουμηνίαι          | 1   | 9      |
| δευτέραι ἱσταμένου | 2   | 17     |
| τρίτει ἱσταμένου   | 3   | 15     |
| τετράδι ἱσταμένου  | 4   | 16     |
| πέμπτει ἱσταμένου  | 5   | 16     |
| ἕκτηι ἱσταμένου    | 6   | 14     |
| ἑβδόμηι ἱσταμένου  | 7   | 16     |
| ὀγδόηι ἱσταμένου   | 8   | 15     |
| ἐνάτηι ἱσταμένου   | 9   | 9      |
| δεκάτηι ἱσταμένου  | 10  | 10     |
| ἑνδεκάτηι          | 11  | 11     |
| δωδεκάτηι          | 12  | 12     |
| τρίτηι ἐπὶ δέκα    | 13  | 13     |
| τετράδι ἐπὶ δέκα   | 14  | 14     |
| πέμπτηι ἐπὶ δέκα   | 15  | 14     |
| ἕκτηι ἐπὶ δέκα     | 16  | 12     |
| ἑβδόμηι ἐπὶ δέκα   | 17  | 14     |
| ὀγδόηι ἐπὶ δέκα    | 18  | 13     |
| ἐνάτηι ἐπὶ δέκα    | 19  | 13     |

#### The Backwards Count

The last days, however, are counted backwards as if to reflect the waning moon. From the fifth through most of the fourth century, the count after εἰκοστή  (20th) used φθίνοντος, "waning" or "dwindling" (from [φθίω](https://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CF%86%CE%B8%CE%AF%CF%89)). It is in the genitive--we must supply the word μηνός so δεκάτηι φθίνοντος means "the tenth of the waning (moon)"


| Name               | Full Month day | Hollow Month Day |Letters |
|--------------------|---------------:|------------------|--------|
| εἰκοστῆι           | 20             | 20               | 8      |
| δεκάτηι φθίνοντος  | 21             | --/21            | 16     |
| ἐνάτηι φθίνοντος   | 22             | 21/22            | 15     |
| ὀγδόηι φθίνοντος   | 23             | 22/23            | 15     |
| ἑβδόμηι φθίνοντος  | 24             | 23/24            | 16     |
| ἕκτηι φθίνοντος    | 25             | 24/25            | 14     |
| πέμπτηι φθίνοντος  | 26             | 25/26            | 16     |
| τετράδι φθίνοντος  | 27             | 26/27            | 16     |
| τρίτηι φθίνοντος   | 28             | 27/28            | 15     |
| δευτέραι φθίνοντος | 29             | 28/--            | 17     |
| ἕνηι καὶ νέαι      | 30             | 29               | 11     |

The backwards count is different for full and hollow months. The "ninth of the waning moon" is the 22nd in a full month (nine days from the 30th, counting inclusively) but of a hollow month it is the 21st or the 22nd depending on your theory of the "omitted" day (see below). ἕνη καὶ νέα is the 30th of a full month or the 29th of a hollow.

Towards the end of the fourth century, a new style came into use, counting backwards with μετ’ εἰκάδας ("after the 20th") instead of φθίνοντος. In this style, the 20th is called (oddly) δεκάτη προτέρα or "the prior tenth", the 21st δεκάτη ὑστέρα, "the later 10th"


| Name                  | Full Month day | Hollow Month Day |Letters |
|-----------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| δεκάτηι προτέραι      | 20             | 20               | 15     |
| δεκάτηι ὑστέραι       | 21             | 21               | 14     |
| ἐνάτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   | 22             | --/22            | 16     |
| ὀγδόηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   | 23             | 22/23            | 16     |
| ἑβδόμηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | 24             | 23/24            | 17     |
| ἕκτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας    | 25             | 24/25            | 15     |
| πέμπτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | 26             | 25/26            | 17     |
| τετράδι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | 27             | 26/27            | 17     |
| τρίτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   | 28             | 27/28            | 16     |
| δευτέραι μετ’ εἰκάδας | 29             | 28/--            | 18     |
| ἕνηι καὶ νέαι         | 30             | 29               | 11     |

For a time, there was a theory that the count μετ’ εἰκάδας was a "forward" count (that is, δευτέραι μετ’ εἰκάδας might be the 22nd, followed by τρίτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας, etc.), but this has been dismissed. Care must be taken with restorations to make sure they are not based on a forward count.

There has always been disagreement about the "omitted" day. Since the 20th has a specific name (εἰκοστῆ, δεκάτη προτέρα) and the last day is always ἕνη καὶ νέα whether it is the 29th or the 30th, in a hollow month there is not room between the two for the full count from δεκάτη φθίνοντος down to δευτέρα φθίνοντος or later, when δεκάτη ὑστέρα is the name of the 21st, from ἐνάτη μετ’ εἰκάδας to δευτέρα μετ’ εἰκάδας. Merrit's final firm view was that ἐνάτη μετ’ εἰκάδας was the omitted day so that in a hollow month, the 21st was δεκάτη ὑστέρα, the 22nd ὀγδόη μετ’ εἰκάδας. Pritchett believed just as firmly that the omitted day was δευτέρα μετ’ εἰκάδας, so that in a hollow month, the 22nd was ἐνάτη μετ’ εἰκάδας and the 28th τρίτη μετ’ εἰκάδας proceeding then to ἕνη καὶ νέα.

Therefore, for hollow month, the count with φθίνοντος would proceed according to each of them:

| Day | Meritt             | Pritchett         |
|-----|--------------------|-------------------|
| 20  | εἰκοστῆι           | εἰκοστῆι          |
| 21  | ἐνάτηι φθίνοντος   | δεκάτηι φθίνοντος |
| 22  | ὀγδόηι φθίνοντος   | ἐνάτηι φθίνοντος  |
| 23  | ἑβδόμηι φθίνοντος  | ὀγδόηι φθίνοντος  |
| 24  | ἕκτηι φθίνοντος    | ἑβδόμηι φθίνοντος |  
| 25  | πέμπτηι φθίνοντος  | ἕκτηι φθίνοντος   |
| 26  | τετράδι φθίνοντος  | πέμπτηι φθίνοντος |
| 27  | τρίτηι φθίνοντος   | τετράδι φθίνοντος |
| 28  | δευτέραι φθίνοντος | τρίτηι φθίνοντος  |

And the count with μετ’ εἰκάδας

| Day | Meritt                | Pritchett            |
|-----|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 20  | δεκάτηι προτέραι      | δεκάτηι προτέραι     |
| 21  | δεκάτηι ὑστέραι       | δεκάτηι ὑστέραι      |
| 22  | ὀγδόηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   | ἐνάτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  |
| 23  | ἑβδόμηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | ὀγδόηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  |
| 24  | ἕκτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας    | ἑβδόμηι μετ’ εἰκάδας |  
| 25  | πέμπτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | ἕκτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   |
| 26  | τετράδι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | πέμπτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας |
| 27  | τρίτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας   | τετράδι μετ’ εἰκάδας |
| 28  | δευτέραι μετ’ εἰκάδας | τρίτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας  | 
| 29  | ἕνηι καὶ νέαι         | ἕνηι καὶ νέαι        |

When it is not certain whether a date with φθίνοντος or μετ’ εἰκάδας is in a full month or a hollow, there are three possible interpretations. πέμπτηι μετ’ εἰκάδας could be: the 26th in a full month, the 26th in a hollow month according to Pritchett's scheme, or the 25th in a hollow month according to Meritt's.
