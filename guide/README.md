If you are new to the Athenian calendar, start with [Festival Calendar Basics](festival-calendar-basics.md) and [The Conciliar Calendar](conciliar-calendar.md). Athenians used these two parallel calendars and it is their differences and overlaps that allow us to explore many of the details about how they reckoned the year.

[`heniautos` Command](heniautos-command.md) has full details about how to use `heniautos` to generate many different views of the Athenian calendar.

Once you are more interested in the nitty-gritty of this calendar, read  [Calendar Equations](calendar-equations.md) and [`calendar-equations` Command](calendar-equations-command.md) to get started on the fascinating (and frustrating) puzzles in the evidence from ancient dated inscriptions.

[Programming with Heniautos](programming-with-heniautos.md) is the full guide to using the Heniautos Python library for writing your own programs.

Finally, [Reading Dated Inscriptions](reading-dated-inscriptions.md) is a very brief overview of the prescripts of dated decrees of the Athenian Ekklēsía that give us so much information about ancient dates. These prescripts follow a fairly inflexible formula, so once you know a few principles, you can easily read many of these inscriptions yourself.
